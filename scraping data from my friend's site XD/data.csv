0,Bliss,"Jul 4, 2020","It was the 101th day of the nationwide lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic and I was at my usual place just across the ‘London Bridge’ in Nadipur. The coffee there is mediocre but the place itself is calm and relaxing.It has many plants hanging around on the flowerpots and is decorated with old car tires giving it a distinct charm.The only complaint that I have about the place could be the scourge of mosquitoes but today was not one of those days. I ordered an espresso, a few cigarettes and sat on my usual spot in the corner. I looked around and noticed that the other tables were empty. So I took the marijuana which I had got by begging with my friend and lit it. My 101th day-streak of mariujana free days were over and with every puff, the mariujana started hitting me harder. I can’t tell whether it was because I hadn’t smoked for a long time or because the marijuana itself was of very high quality but it was really good.

Cannot be hurt, never to die
Boon of immortality

2,Giving It Up,"Nov 24, 2019","It is really difficult for me now-a-days  not to smoke as most of  my friends do so and when I see one of them light up a cigarette and suck it in making that “yellow glow”,  the subtle crisp sound of burning tobacco echoes through my ears; the remembrance of the  experience  arouses and invites me making my  jaw feel heavy with two small ponds of saliva manifesting on the back of my tongue.  My eyes widen to the scenario with my focus entirely on the slow rising smoke from the tiny yellow flame forcing my hand to make an indistinct move towards it . I look around me and I’m the only outcast who’s not smoking. The feeling of non-belongingness also hits me in addition to the immense desire to hold that cigarette finely between index and middle finger of my right hand directing it towards my lips which are longing for its cushionous touch and inhale the sacred whitish-gray air that goes inside and gives me a feeling of relief and ease and exhale after taking every bit of life inside that and make rings out the smoke while doing so which gives me a short and slight feeling of glory displaying that with enough effort I can even make rings out of thin air.

3,The Dillema,"Aug 2, 2017","Walking on the deserted street,
I’m tired and the sun is about to fade
I need to stop and call it for the day
In the distance,
I see a small house, a hovel
I reach to its tiny door just about to open
Will they have enough?
  For another empty stomach
Again, 
I walk on the same street
In the distance,
I see a big house, a manor
I reach to its huge gateway, just about to open
Will I be good enough?
  For those fat cats, eating with the knives
Again, I walk on the same street
After long hours, can’t continue so I turn back
Sun is about to rise
Neither did I stop, nor can I walk
